        <li>Offside Rule</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The offensive player is offside if they are nearer to the opponentâ€™s
            goal line than both the second and last opponent and the soccer ball
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          If the ball goes out of play off an attacking player on the baseline
          then it is given as a goal kick
        </li>
        <li>
          If a foul occur in the penalty area, the fouled team is awarded a
          penalty kick
        </li>
        <li>
          Each team is only allowed to make a maximum of 3 substitutions. If a
          team uses all three substitutions and a player has to leave the field
          for injury, the team will be forced to continue the game without
          having a replacement for the player
